        <h3>Star Wars saga</h3>
        <p>The Star Wars saga, also referred to as the Skywalker saga, is the main line of Star Wars films that began
          in
          1977 with Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which was originally titled Star Wars. While a larger universe
          of
          stories and characters has evolved around it, the saga films tell the story of the Skywalker family through
          a
          set of three trilogies. The original trilogy ran from 1977 to 1983, which was followed by the prequel
          trilogy
          from 1999 to 2005, and the sequel trilogy from 2015 to 2019. .. .. <a href="articlepg1.html">read more

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <h4>“George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. His 'Star
          Wars' movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made.”</h4>
